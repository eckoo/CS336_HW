# CS336_HW

To generate my data for the second question of the homework, and for more specifics you can visit the Problem2.java file, 
I used the Random library to generate all of the random data required by 100 students. There are several different
String arrays that I used to populate all necessary fields, with comments. 

To load the data, I used an insert statement - in the process of inserting, I checked if the class I was attempting
to insert was a duplicate. If so, I did not add it, and if I did it would be added. The option for each student was
to randomly be generated a number of unique classes between 1 and 35, between grades A - F.

All code used is contained within the files.
